Cornetto to MySQL Convertor
===========================
The "Cornetto to MySQL Convertor" converts the Cornetto XML files to SQL file for importing the data into a MySQL database.

**NOTE:**
Please, first use the scheme file (read the Installation below!) to create the MySQL scheme, before applying the insert queries (generated by this script).


Requirements
------------
In order to use this Cornetto to MySQL convertor, the following requirements should be met:

- Python 2.7 is installed
- MySQL database is installed & running
- You got the full copy of the Cornetto database (from: http://tst-centrale.org/producten/lexica/cornetto/7-56)

*Optionally:*

- Get the word count database (wcl) as well 
		(use the Python scripts from: https://github.com/emsrc/pycornetto/tree/master/bin)

**Note:**
The documentation is based on GNU/Linux operating system, but it should also work with Windows or Mac OS X.

Installation Convertor
----------------------

1. Copy both cdbxx.lu.xml (lexical unit) & cdbxx.syn.xml (synset) files to this folder.
2. Rename the files respectively to cdb_lu.xml and cdb_syn.xml
3. Open a terminal window.
4. Change directory to this folder.
5. Execute on the command line: 

    ```
    ./cornetto_to_sql_mysql.py
    ```
6. Wait when the script is done, cornetto_mysql_data.sql file is created when finished.
7. Go to 'Installation MySQL' for futher instructions.


Installation MySQL
------------------
See the commands below, which should be executed into a terminal.

1. Login into MySQL. 
2. Create a MySQL database called 'cornetto' (if necessary: drop existing database).
3. Import the scheme sql file (cornetto_mysql_scheme.sql) into the cornetto database.
4. Increase Max Allowed Packet of the MySQL server.
5. Import the data sql file (cornetto_mysql_data.sql) into the cornetto database (get some coffee, this can take at least 10 min.).
6. Done :) You can now use the MySQL version of the Cornetto database!

Enter the commands respectively:

1. 
    ```mysql -u root -p --show-warnings```
2. 
    ```DROP DATABASE cornetto; CREATE DATABASE cornetto; USE cornetto; source cornetto_mysql_schema.sql; SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=1073741824;```
3. 
    ```source cornetto_mysql_data.sql;```


Help
----
MySQL database can be used in all kinds of code and applications, e.g. PHP and Python often in combination with 'MySQL driver'.

You can use the [Diagram image](cornetto_mysql.png) for the database enhanced entityâ€“relationship (EER) diagram.
This diagram helps you understand how the database is set up and how to write your MySQL queries.
